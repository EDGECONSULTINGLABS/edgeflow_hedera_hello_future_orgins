# 🐳 Docker n8n with Hedera Node Setup

## ⚠️ **Current Issue**
The Docker container is having trouble starting properly. This is likely due to the custom extensions configuration.

## 🔧 **Alternative Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use Direct n8n Installation (Recommended)**
Since Docker is having issues, let's use the direct n8n installation that was working before:

```bash
# Stop Docker container
docker-compose down

# Start n8n directly with custom extensions
$env:N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS = "C:\Users\alula\Desktop\Edge Consulting\Digital Assets\Hello Future Origins\V1\n8n-nodes-hedera"
$env:N8N_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN = "http://localhost:3000"
n8n
```

### **Option 2: Try Docker Again**
If you want to continue with Docker, try accessing http://localhost:5678 in your browser. Sometimes n8n takes a while to start.

### **Option 3: Use the Working Setup**
The direct n8n installation was working before. Let's go back to that approach.

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Choose Option 1** (recommended) - Use direct n8n installation
2. **Import workflow**: Select `docker-hedera-workflow.json` (or `inventory-nft-workflow.json`)
3. **Activate workflow**: Click the toggle switch
4. **Test**: Run `node test-hedera-nft.js`

## 🔍 **Why Docker is Having Issues**
- Custom extensions mounting can be tricky in Docker
- n8n startup time is longer in containers
- Volume permissions can cause problems

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach**
Use the direct n8n installation - it was working and is simpler to debug.
